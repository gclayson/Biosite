					       <h2><strong>This is Sal's Story</strong><br /></h2>
				               <p>Salvador De La Torre came into the world at St. Joseph’s Hospital in Orange, California. 
								   It was in the dark hours of the morning that he was born. Sal was quoted as saying “I’ve been crying ever since”. 
								   He was playing like any other child his age until he was bitten by the “creativity Bug”.
								  At ten years old he had the means with which to act on his creative urge. Sal discovered a video camcorder along with a couple of VCRs. 
								  He started making action comedies with his sister and wrote and acted in his own stories. 
								  After viewing Jurassic Park, the lure of using his own props for special effects.</p>
								<p>Sal developed a taste for independent films and seeing the finished product piqued his interest in the production side. 
									He has stepped up to the buffet of film styles and has not looked back. 
									Starting down the road with Pulp Fiction, to Pleasantville, to Sin City Sal has realized a range of styles. 
									He felt a kinship with the process and the personalities involved. 
									The transition from viewer to filmmaker has taken hold.</p>
								<p>Although he enjoys watching movies Sal feels he can discover and develop his own style and contribute to long heritage of great directors. 
									Sal has used the palette of styles to springboard into action and take a hands-on approach to learning all aspects of the process. 
									Following the tradition of great filmmakers, 
									he wants to produce and introduce iconic movies to the next generation of film goers so he can join their ranks.</p>

					<h3><b>Sal's Journey "There's Always a Beginning"</b></h3> 
				<div class="journey">
					<div id="start">
						<p>
						Sal started his acting pursuit in high school. 
						His first role at Loara High School was a remake of the classic film “Twelve Angry Men”. Sal played the role of juror #3, equivalent to the part played by George C. Scott in the movie. 
						His next role was a part in a 1700 restoration comedy called “The Beaux Strategy. The movie equivalent was “Dirty Rotten Scoundrels”, Sal played the part of Aimwell. 
						This is where he was introduced to Danny. Danny was a part of a local troupe called “Local Super Heroes”, who were producing parodies of films.
		                 So, thinking like-minded, Danny enlisted Sal.</p>
						<p>Local Super Heroes consisted of three producers, RJ, Danny, and Adam. 
						Sal learned the ins and outs of production which gave him the experience he needed to progress on his path. 
						His first role with the group was in a parody of a popular music video called “Stacey’s Mom”.
						Going between theatre and being involved with production gave Sal a well-rounded idea as to what is needed to make movies. 
						This collaboration has evolved from being a participant to a co-producer in film production. 
						The natural step was the formation of “Laughing Owl Productions”.</p>
						<p>With Laughing Owl Productions Sal has been able to go from film shorts to making longer movies.
						“Sal Buys a Megaphone” is an example of this, where he made an actual serious mockumentary that was entered in a film festival. 
						Sal ‘s film is a commentary of a character who is convinced what he was doing is real but blurred the lines. The truth is just a tool, you shouldn’t be confined by it. 
						He has also produced films for a local artist and shot footage at his artshows. The films are set as a conversation in a interview format.
						To see his progress there are links to his channels.</p>
						<p>Sal most recent film production has involved interpreting visual poems.
						Trying to accurately convey his feelings and moods. He recently was cast in a sci-horror vehicle where he played a homeless man. 
						With the Covid 19 situation suspending a lot of productions, Sal was able to get cast in an on-line Shakespeare production of “As You Like It”, 
						playing the role of Orlando. It was his first taste of Shakespeare. I am impressed that the production was able to unite and create such a sophisticated piece on-line.</p>
						<p>Sal has a couple of goals soon. He wants to tackle more Shakespeare, 
							to increase his range and flex his acting muscles.
							 He also has a personal project he would like to accomplish. 
							 His friend Kaitlyn was found dead but left a screen play. 
							Sal wants to make her last wish come to fruition.</p>

					  <h7 id="Mentor" ><strong>Akira Kurosawa</strong></h7></br>I asked Sal about who influenced his filmmaking path. 
					  The guiding light of his foundation in producing movies. The first name brought up was Japanese director Akira Kurosawa.
					   I said why Akira? Sal replied with out batting an eye, Kurosawa transcends his medium, takes it where it makes the trail not takes it.      
					 Kurosawa was quoted as saying <q>For me, filmmaking combines everything. That’s the reason I’ve made cinema my life’s work. 
					   In films, painting and literature, theatre and music come together. But a film is still a film.”</q><br/>
                       Kurosawa’s films are cultural and temporal at their best and represented the best of their craft.
					   His thirty films out of span fifty-seven-year career showed how creative inspiration could leave its mark on an industry of mediocrity. 
					   Akira went from painter to director. Kurosawa displayed a bold, dynamic style, strongly influenced by western cinema, and yet had its own flavor. <br/>
					  <em>The Seven Samurai</em> is an example of a film took several themes and influenced the next generation of action films. <em>Ran</em> is the example I put here to give a feel of Kurosawa's craft.
					  Sal has been inspired by Kurosawa’s approach to filming and took to it like fish to water. 
					  The use of black and white film gave a realistic atmosphere to the theme and subject matter.
					   The extent with which Akira took to it is amazing. 
					   Akira took a perspective that Sal feels he cannot achieve but will strive for. </p>
				     <p><img src="Quentin.jpg" alt="Quentin"  class="align-right medium"/>
						 <h7><strong>Quentin Tarantino</strong></h7></br>I asked Sal for the most influential filmmakers he could think of.
						  I wanted to understand through Sal’s eyes, not an argument on hierarchy. I asked him to narrow it down to three filmmakers for the purposes of this biosite. 
						  The second one he chose was Quentin Tarantino. <br/>
						 Tarantino is just fun filmmaking, and you know it. Use of language and colorful metaphors with the ultra-violence seems to have influenced Sal. 
						 I asked what his favorite Quentin vehicle was expecting to hear <em>Pulp Fiction</em>, but Sal responded with <em>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</em>. 
						 One of the more recent ventures which superseded the timing of my question.  
						 Sal interjected that his personal references with the music allowed a modern Los Angeles flavor that marked his spot. <br/>
						 Sal sems to be attracted to Quentin’s use of non-linear storylines which feature neo-noire alternative history films. 
						 Quoted as saying <q>I’m a genre lover-everything from spaghetti westerns to samurai movies</q>, Quentin has taunted Sal into improving his productions and throwing caution to the wind. 
						 Taking a mesh and not just letting stereotypic stories take over everything but boldly experimenting 
						 and participating in the act of discovery. </p>
					
						<p><img src="kubrik.jpg" alt="kubrik"  class="align-left medium" />
						<h7 id="Mentor" ><strong>Stanley Kubrik</strong></h7></br>The third influential filmmaker I asked for was Stanley Kubrick. 
						Sal seemed particularly enthralled by Kubrick’s independence as a filmmaker, each movie he made was different and reflected stories that Kubrick liked. 
						Stanley had a way of skirting around a scene using a visual style and dialogue that reflected his personal journey. <br/>
						Sal feels his journey as a participant in cinema parallels Kubrick. Stanley attended high school during world war 2 and was only average as academics go. 
						He displayed a keen interest in literature, photography and film and taught himself all aspects of film production.
						 He began making short films on a shoestring budget until his break in 1956 with <em>The Killing</em> from Universal Studios. 
						 After creative differences with the studio he moved to London. <br/>
						Sal pointed out the traits that allowed Kubrick to stand up for his independence and make his own cinematic path.  
						So, I asked out of the many films Kubrick worked on which he particularly favored, he responded with a resounding<em>Barry Lyndon</em> . <br/>
						Sal cited the fact that Kubrick used tech and period accuracy to an advantage that allowed the viewer to look through Kubrick’s eyes. 
						Kubrick’s adaptability to turn an industry on its early just telling a story how he saw it and not the cinematic formula at the time is now churning the wheels of Sal’s creativity. 
						Best summed up by this quote ,<q>Perhaps it sounds ridiculous, but the best thing that young filmmakers should do is to get hold of a camera and some film and make a movie of any kind at all.</q>
						-- Stanley Kubrick
